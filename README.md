# BioElectronic-Design-Assignment
```
The following repo contains submission folders for activities 1-4 for HW2
```
**Goal**: Form an understanding of the complexity of microfluidic design problems and how
computational design tools can be used to build them. In order to help build your skill-sets
towards lab automation, you will be required to design a microfluidic device platform DeltaV
that would enable the design and development of modern day gene therapeutics.
